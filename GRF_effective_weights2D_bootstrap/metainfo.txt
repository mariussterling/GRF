Description: 'Estimation of effective weights alpha_i(x_1, x_2) for the infeasable observations theta_tilde. The effective weights are computed by a regression forest on a grid of observations x_ij=(-0.5 + i/n1, 0 + 0.02 * j) for i=1,...,n1 and j=0,...,50, for n1=50, 100, 200 and target variable Y_i=theta(x_ij) + eps_ij, for a given theta function, here triangle function theta(x_ij) = max(0, 1 - |x_ij,1|/0.2), with Gaussian noise eps_ij with mean zero and standard deviation of 0 and 0.1.'

Keywords: 'RF, GRF, infeasable function, estimation, effective weights, bandwidth, contour'
