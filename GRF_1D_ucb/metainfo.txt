Published in: 'GRF'

Description: 'A simple code to construct bootstrap assisted uniform confidence bands for various 1D examples. The support folder contains a separate 
file called 'functions' in which various functions can be commented/uncommented easily for calculation of power, size or coverage. The code also 
provides option to fit both quantile forest and regression forest, and relevant code lines need to be uncommented accordingly. Furthermore, same code
can be used to make plots corresponding to changing bandwidth, grid size, theta, etc. The code is written to perform multiple corelated tasks and 
therefore separate files are not made for each task..
