Description: 'Estimation of effective weights alpha_i(x_1) for the infeasable observations theta_tilde. The effective weights are computed by a quantile regression forest on a grid of observation for given n and target variable Y_i=theta(x_ij) + eps_ij, for a given theta function, here triangle function theta(x_ij) = max(0, 1 - |x_ij,1|/0.2), with Gaussian noise eps_ij with mean zero and standard deviation of 0 and 0.1.' The theta is then estimated and the estimated function is tested on a new grid to calculate coverage of true theta by the point wise confidence intervals created using multiplier bootstrap. At last, simultaneous confidence intervals are calculated and plotted
